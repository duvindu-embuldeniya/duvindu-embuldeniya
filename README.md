## Hi there 👋
![Profile views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=duvindu-embuldeniya&label=Profile%20views&color=0e75b6&style=flat)

💻 Focused on backend development using Django and Django REST Framework, building API-driven features and optimizing system performance. Managed deployments on AWS with a strong focus on scalability, reliability, and secure infrastructure.

🚀 I learn by breaking down and rebuilding systems to understand their inner workings. By prototyping and experimenting, I stay adaptable and constantly improve my knowledge. I aim to collaborate on innovative projects and work within teams to develop impactful applications. Building scalable systems and expanding my knowledge are my top priorities.

☁️ My focus is on building efficient, user-friendly platforms with seamless functionality.
