## Hi there üëã

üíª I primarily work on backend development using Django, with experience in designing and managing scalable systems on AWS.

üöÄ I learn by breaking down and rebuilding systems to understand their inner workings. By prototyping and experimenting, I stay adaptable and constantly improve my knowledge. I aim to collaborate on innovative projects and work within teams to develop impactful applications. Building scalable systems and expanding my knowledge are my top priorities.

‚òÅÔ∏è My focus is on building efficient, user-friendly platforms with seamless functionality. I'm also currently learning ReactJS to expand my full-stack capabilities.
